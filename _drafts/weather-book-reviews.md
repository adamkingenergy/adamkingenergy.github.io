Weather is one of the fundamental drivers of both the supply and demand side of the energy balance.  There are many excellent meteorological textbooks and also a few books specific to the influence of weather on the energy markets available.

### Wind Energy Meteorology

This book covers a great deal of depth in the meso-scale meteorology governing flows across wind turbines.  It is densely packed with equations describing the key concepts which did make the book a little impenetrable at times.

Generally, the start of the book was useful for its coverage of geostrophic winds, thermal winds and the boundary layers.  The remainder of the book was probably more depth than is useful for analysing and trading wind energy.
