Energy trading and risk-management is a relatively niche topic, but is fortunately well-served by excellent books from several publishers.  Since the discipline spans different aspects of physics, economics, game-theory, stochastics, optimisation and operations research, each book inevitably has its own slant.

### Economics of the International Coal Trade

By Lars Schernikau, ISBN: 978-90-481-9239-7

This book is pretty much the only one I have been able to find which is dedicated to the coal market.  Although now a few years old, almost all the content is still comprehensive and current.

Early sections discuss the many grades of coal, their characteristics, geographical situation and process of formation - information which still remains broadly relevant.  Later sections which cover the supply and demand characteristics of the market would probably benefit from a new edition, but if you are learning about coal from scratch as I did, the information is still very interesting.

Unexpectedly, the book then goes into detail of the industrial competition models which, depending on certain assumptions, can be considered as governing the global coal market. The section was a very good walk through of both the different types of competition model (Cournot, Bertrand, Stackelberg etc.) and a description of the linear programming model given in the appendix (using GAMS).

I would highly recommend this book, even if you only deal in coal incidentally as a fuel for thermal generation.

### Power Generation Handbook

A very comprehensive guide to the physics and systems behind power generation.  Given the size and detail in the book, I found it best to read the introductory chapters fully, then only dipped into the dense detail when required.

In the first few chapters, the book starts with the fundamentals of thermodynamics, followed by steam turbine designs.  The coverage of combined-cycle systems, economic considerations during operation and AC machine fundamentals in later chapters were particularly useful.

In the context of energy trading this book has some interesting detail on performance and efficiency of combined-cycle systems, but the majority of the content is specific to plant engineering.  Such engineering knowledge is interesting background but generally not cruicial for the day-to-day.
