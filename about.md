I'm a trader in the European electricity markets.  These markets provide many opportunities to analyse data and optimise assets so I spend at-least half my time hacking data in [IPython](http://ipython.org).  I also build larger distributed market models which aim to forecast market prices and plant behaviours accurately.

On this site I hope to share a few interesting things from my free time: some data analysis, software projects, book reviews and other guides I think might be interesting and helpful.
