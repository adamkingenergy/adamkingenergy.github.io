I work as an electricity trader in the European markets.  Mornings are busy, but I tend to make time in the afternoon to build new tools and systems to help better analyse the markets and the physical fundamentals driving them.  My weapon of choice is [IPython](http://ipython.org) for most analysis work but when I'm working on larger distributed systems, [Ã˜MQ](http://zeromq.org) and [memcached](http://memcached.org) are fantastic building blocks.
