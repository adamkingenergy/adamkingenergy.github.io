I trade the European electricity markets for a living.  It's a data-rich industry that lends itself well to modelling and analysis, so I get to spend half my time coding Python.

Besides my [Trayport](http://www.trayport.com) screens,  I always have plenty of [IPython](http://ipython.org) notebooks up and running, in my opinion the most powerful tool out there for hacking data.

Not surprisingly, my contract does not allow me to discuss any trading activities or development I do for the firm.  These articles are therefore purely about a some spare-time projects, a few references/guides and some other things that are interesting.
